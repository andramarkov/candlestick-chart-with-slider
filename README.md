## A python code for creating candlestick charts with range slider using bokeh
This code means to showcase a part of workflow specific to technical analysis:
* connecting to a sql database (via sqlite) to extract price data for a specific trading instrument, and
* plotting a candlestick chart with a range slider and a tooltip for detailed price info

To ilustrate the functionality I'm using a jupyter notebook and dummy data (daily OHLC for two instruments - EURUSD currency pair, and Apple stock)
