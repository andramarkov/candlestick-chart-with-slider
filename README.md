## A python code for creating candlestick charts with range slider using bokeh
This code is meant to showcase part of workflow specific to technical analysis:
* connecting to a sql database to extract price data for a specific trading instrument, and
* plotting a candlestick chart with a range slider and a tooltip for detailed price info

To ilustrate the functionality I'm using a jupyter notebook and daily OHLC price data for two instruments (EURUSD currency pair, and Apple stock) stored in a sqlite database.
